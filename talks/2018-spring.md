## Talks

#### Anton Moldovan @AntyaDev: Adopting F# at SBTech

In this talk, I will share our experience of adopting F# at SBTech. Will cover such topics: 
- why F#?
- under what circumstances we decided to give a try
- adopting F# for C#/OOP developers (inconveniences, C# interoperability, code style, domain modeling, testing)

#### August Lilleaas: Datomic — The Functional Database

Datomic is a brand new kind of database. Queries runs on the client/app, not on the database server. It writes data to other databases, instead of implementing its own storage engine. It has a completely different API for reads vs. writes. And it's single threaded (and, believe it or not, this is an amazing idea).
This will be a quick run-through of Datomic and why the aforementioned things are not just good, but great!

#### Kostiantyn Rybnikov @ko_bx: Idris for Haskell Developers

The purpose of the talk is to give the audience familiar with Haskell a good taste of Idris. Often we are put off by an idea of learning yet another language (like Haskell wasn't enough!). But Idris is unique in a sense that experience of studying it for somebody already familiar with Haskell has a blazingly fast liftoff until you hit the dependently-typed wall, but that's where the fun part begins.

Spoiler alert! If you are already committed to reading the "Type-Driven Development with Idris" book by Edwin Brady, and you hate spoilers (I don't) — beware.

#### Sergey Bushnyak @sigrlami: Practical Frontend with Haskell and Reflex FRP

I'll show how to build shared structures between frontend and backend in Haskell and how to write frontend separately staying within functional concepts.

#### Bohdan Liesnikov @phittacus: Measuring Haskell Performance

A lightning talk on performance measurements.
